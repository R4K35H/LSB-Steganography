DISGUISE:GUI Based Secret Data Insertion Support for Engineers

This project is an GUI based implementation of LSB and DWT Steganography techniques.

Abstract:
In this project work entitled “DISGUISE:GUI Based Secret Data Insertion Support for Engineers”, 
Graphical User Interface for two basic image steganographic technique is developed. 
With the help of GUI secret text message is inserted into cover image using LSB or DWT algorithm 
and a stego image is generated. Secret message, embedding ratio, maximum payload capacity,cover image, 
cover image resolution, stego image are shown on the GUI screen. Steganalysis operations like histogram 
analysis, PSNR, MSE, and SSIM are performed on the stego image to check its imperceptibility.
The secret message from the stego image is extracted using the decoding GUI. The stegoimage is given as 
inputto the decoding after that the user select the decoding algorithm (LSB or DWT), on the basis of the 
decoding algorithm the secret message is extracted and displayed on GUI screen.

To run the code simply execute DISGUISE.m file and the GUI will guide you......
